notes:
- javascipt to create the listings table and bids table
- will fetch the data from the listings.json file
- first will fetch the whole json file, maybe later implement only part of json thats needed
- Need to implement status codes
- break up python into separate file that has helper functions?
- 

NEED TO FIX:
- error with submitting a second bid. This is because the url changes and the javascript fetches the listing id from the url. This can be changed by adding in a separate element that is hidden with the bidId that is generated by the server and put on the webpage. Then have the javascript add this number into the form.
