    <!--Information about the company-->
    <p><strong>About us: </strong><em>EliteBid House</em> has been an auction house in business for over 75 years. We originated in Eastern Kentucky, back when my Grandfather and Grandmother started a garage sale. Things gradually expanded reaching the whole state of Kentucky in 10 years. Now we cover the whole continental US and some parts of South America.</p>
    <p><strong>Our mission </strong>has always been to give our customers the best price for the rarest items. We operate with extremely low commissions and put the price of an item at our utmost concern. We know this is difficult due to the fact when a buyer wants the lowest price and a seller wants the highest. Our previous auction partners have told us our speciality is compromise. We take pride in that. We are proud to say over 96% of both buyers and sellers have been happy post-sale.</p>
    <p><strong>What kind of items do we sell? </strong>Well, pretty much anything. However, we do not sell perishible items or items with a valuation of under $30. If you are unsure with the value of the item you want to sell, we have a free evaluation service. Contact us and we will be happy to help.</p>
    <p>Some examples of items we sell:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Antique furniture</li>
        <li>Jewelry</li>
        <li>Motorcycles</li>
    </ul>
