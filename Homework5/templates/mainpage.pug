                        strong About us: 
                        em EliteBid House
                        |  has been an auction house in business for over 75 years. We
                        |  originated in Eastern Kentucky, back when my Grandfather and Grandmother started a garage sale. Things gradually
                        |  expanded reaching the whole state of Kentucky in 10 years. Now we cover the whole continental US and some parts
                        |  of South America.
                    p
                        strong Our mission 
                        | has always been to give our customers the best price for the rarest items. We
                        | operate with extremely low commissions and put the price of an item at our utmost concern. We know this is
                        | difficult due to the fact when a buyer wants the lowest price and a seller wants the highest. Our previous
                        | auction partners have told us our speciality is compromise. We take pride in that. We are proud to say over 96%
                        | of both buyers and sellers have been happy post-sale.
                    p
                        strong What kind of items do we sell? 
                        | Well, pretty much anything. However, we do not sell perishible
                        | items or items with a valuation of under $30. If you are unsure with the value of the item you want to sell, we
                        | have a free evaluation service. Contact us and we will be happy to help.
