## Don't forget
* Check previous homeworks for lost points and make sure you fix these things
    * Fix tables size changing as the time information changes
    * Ensure client-side validation that the bid amount is larger than the largest current bid
* Remove image width attribute on viewListing.pug (or at least check that this passes an HTML validator)
